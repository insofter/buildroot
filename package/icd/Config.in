          ICD is a software package for counting of moving objects. It works
          with one or more photocell. The passing objects (e.g. people)
          generates input state transitions which are counted, aggregated
          and later sendto a server

          This package also relays on some custom device drivers which are
          expected to be included in the kernel.
